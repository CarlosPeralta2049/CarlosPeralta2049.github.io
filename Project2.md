**Objective:** To explore key financial instruments that may improve investment decisions

## Financial (Fundamental) Analysis
Fundamental analysis is a subset of financial analysis that utilises economic and quantitative instruments to analyse the intrinsic value of an asset. Elasticity of demand is one of those instruments. It tells an asset's value relative to the demand of another. For reference purposes, the United States Dollar (USD) may serve as a baseline, even though in the long run it has depreciated. Consider its value against the SNP500 (which is correlated with the Nasdaq), then consider that the Nasdaq has higher elasticity. <br>**RELEANCE:** Confirming a positive trend in the SNP500 gives the NASDAQ has a good chance of increasing its price by a greater amount.
