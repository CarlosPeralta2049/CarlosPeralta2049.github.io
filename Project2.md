**Objective:** To explore key financial instruments that may improve investment decisions

## Financial (Fundamental) Analysis
Fundamental analysis is a subset of financial analysis that utilises economic and quantitative instruments to analyse the intrinsic value of an asset. Elasticity of demand is one of those instruments. It tells an asset's value relative to the demand of another. For reference purposes, the United States Dollar (USD) may serve as a baseline, even though in the long run it has depreciated. Consider its value against the SNP500 (which is correlated with the Nasdaq), then consider that the Nasdaq has higher elasticity. <br>**RELEANCE:** Confirming a positive trend in the SNP500 gives the NASDAQ has a good chance of increasing in value by a greater amount.

#### Long Run USD Depreciation v SNP500 (top 25)
**Below:** Among the top 25 companies in the SNP500, tech stocks are the most luxurious in the long run, as seen by their returns and market cap.<br><br>

### Most of the top ten most profitable companies are in tech
**Below:** A core feature of luxurious assets is their high levels of volatility.

### Assembling a Strategy
Following a government's or the Reserve Bank's stimulatory macro economic announcements the markets may respond with a sustained uptrend. Based on personal levels of risk aversion and risk management experience  individuals may select the frequency with which they invest, and if that should occcur in volatile markets. Professionals regularly to utilise technical analysis to buy long or sell short more often and in the short term. 

In the ideal scenario, government spending and all inflation would occur at the same time as currency depreciation, following interest rate reductions and capital outflows. Asset prices would continiously rise as long as interest rate increases are not announced. The situation temporarily makes the USD an inferior asset. Coupled with the compounding effect of luxury asset volatility and leveraged borrowing we find high levels of risk and reward.

**Below:** For example, a professional who is experienced in risk management may opt to trade TSLA because it has the higher volatility, as identiied by its standard deviation.<br><br>

## Financial (Technical) Analysis
Technical analysis extends financial analysis by analyzing historical price movements with technical indicators which are based on mathematical calculations. The two types of instruments commonly used are moving averages which analyse across varying timeframes, and oscillators which for example may analyse an asset's trend momentum at a given price. 
<br><br>
### Augmenting the Moving Average with Machine Learning
Below we find the widely used moving average indicator; this Simple Moving Average (SMA) which is set to a lag of 50 periods. When price goes below it, on average price becomes negative for that period range. One problem here is that in the short run prices are more volatile and there are too many sell signals. Therefore, applying linear regression Machine Learning to predict and smooth price can reduce volatility, reducing entries and exits, augmenting the predictability value of the moving average.<br><br>

### Testing the Relative Strength Index Indicator Against Principal Component Analysis
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an oscillator indicator which shows if an asset is overbought or oversold. When price is high its strength will be high for the trend to continue, and vice versa. Also, below we test this with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) across five years (1826 days). Components are equal but what matters are only the extremes, so when PC1 (RSI) is negative price should be low and vice versa. Therefore, when price is high but the RSI is low, an asset is overbought and vice versa.<br><br>

**Below:** As 2023 begins, the RSI tells us that BTC upside buy strength is above 70% while price a almost at lows not seen in three years. That is a typical positive divergence (buy signal).<br><br>

**Conclusion:** Portfolio management is a matter of risk management. Fundamental Analysis based on macroeconomic theory allows the price forecasting of other assets. Technical Analysis indicators, when combined have the capability of identifying trends as well as giving low risk buy and sell signals. Machine Learning models augment technical analysis indicators.
