**Objective:** To monitor patterns in team conformance (to paid hours) over time. This dashboard identifies reasons for productivity reductions due to conformance

## Workflows and Produtivity:
- Reasons behind reductions of productivity are found over time, ie. hardware faults.
- Workflow disruptions may also be seen training opportunities for further coaching.
- Processes may also be restructured to improve task repeatability to increase productvity.
