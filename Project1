##Macroeconomic Anaylysis
Economies are managed primarily by governments with fiscal policy and by the Central Bank with monetary policy. Fiscal policy affects the real economy where planned expenditure flows into the supply and demand of goods and services. Monetary policy affects the financial economy, where the Central Bank may adjust interest rates for commercial banks, and financial institutions may stimulate the economy with instruments like stock, bond and foreign exchange markets.

However, under normal circumstances that would have been enough debt creation to induce high inflation. From 2008 debt increasingly flowed into the liquidity and money markets (mostly into assets in the banking system).
