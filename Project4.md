**Objective:** Overall, to identify a means by which to reduce the Public (state) Housing Register in New Zealand

## Housing Register Reduction
### Context
By June of 2022 State Housing stock (excl. Transitional Housing) was 64,870, up 3,000 over the previous 5 years. The Public Housing Register had 26,664 eligible applicants, up 20,000 over the previous 5 years. The Ministry of Social Development cannot significantly increase housing stock supply but it can help clients improve their lives to decrease demand. This paper clarifies how the Housing Register size may be reduced.

### Objectives
1)  To highlight Public Housing needs which are likely to significantly increase demand.
2)  To highlight MSD client segments at risk of having long term Public Housing needs.
3)  To recommend 'operational' steps that MSD Service Delivery may take.
4)  To recommend 'policy' steps that HUD and MSD may take.

### What is there the greatest demand for?
The combined Housing Register need for 1-2 bedroom properties makes up 80.12% of its 26,664 total.
71.57% of those 80.12% Adults without children have this need. That's 57.34% of the total<br><br>

<br><br>

### Who has the greatest demand?
The blue line becomes lighter over time. The Register and Benefit receipt number increase together.
The most prevalent segments were 49% under JS and 29% under SPS of total benefit receipt.
61% received JSS for 12 months or more, while 80% received SPS for 12 months or more.<br><br>

### When do they have the greatest demand?
For the 25 to 39 age groups SPS clients were set to briefly overtake JS clients in Q1 2023.  
For SPS clients, this maintains the trend. However, JS clients were set to increase by Q2 2023.

### Why does the greatest demand appear?
As EH grants grew in quantity, this likely increased Assessment Adequacy ratings to 'Severe Need'.
Related Advances also grew, which likely increased Assessment Accessibility ratings to 'Severe Need'.

# **Conclusions**
1)  The greatest "need" is for 1-2 bedroom places, by long-term 25-39 year old Single JS recipients.
2)  Reviewing Adequacy, Accessibility, Affordability SAS criteria can improve their fit for purpose.

# **Recommendations**
1)  OPERATIONS: Set 'employment' targets above the trend. Introduce a productivity KPI in reporting.
2)  OPERATIONS: To reduce 'severe' Adequacy, set renewed EH grants as recoverable. No exceptions.
3)  OPERATIONS: To reduce 'severe' Accessibility, ensure that 'available balances' include HSP access.
4)  POLICY: To reduce 'severe' Affordability, include accommodation benefits in income calculations.
