**Objective:** To identify a means by which to reduce the Public (state) Housing Register in New Zealand

## Housing Register Reduction
<br><br>
### Context
By June of 2022 State Housing stock (excl. Transitional Housing) was 64,870, up 3,000 over the previous 5 years. The Public Housing Register had 26,664 eligible applicants, up 20,000 over the previous 5 years. The Ministry of Social Development cannot significantly increase housing stock supply but it can help clients improve their lives to decrease demand. This paper clarifies how the Housing Register size may be reduced.
