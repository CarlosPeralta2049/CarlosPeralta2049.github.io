**Objective:** To explore the relationship between total government spending and the financial markets

## Macroeconomic Analysis
Economies are managed primarily by governments with fiscal policy and by the Central Bank with monetary policy. The former affects the real economy where planned expenditure flows into the supply and demand of goods and services. The latter affects the financial economy, where Central Banks adjust interest rates for commercial banks, and financial institutions may stimulate the economy with instruments like stock and bond markets.

#### The real (M2) and the financial (Total assets) economies diverged
**Below:** Following the 2008 recession enough debt was created to keep the financial system afloat. Under normal circumstances this would have induced high inflation. From 2008 debt increasingly created flows in the liquidity and money markets (mostly into assets in the banking system).<br><br>

#### The real economy (M2) has diverged relative to the S&P500 Index
**Below:** Interestingly, from 2008 the real economy also separated from the growth of assets in the financial economy, specifically, the S&P500.<br><br>

#### Stock markets have become correlated with the financial economy, creating the perfect situation for wealth transfer
**Below:** This shows that the future favours debtors over savers, and riskier assets over long term bonds. If governments announce increases spending to create war, build roads, etc, the result must be asset price inflation.<br><br>

#### The Financial Economy and the S&P500 share a strong relationship
**Below:** After applying machine learning linear regression, we confirm that the relationship between Total Spending and the S&P500 is strong.<br><br>

### INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE AND THE LATEST STRATEGY
Today we increase public debt levels to maintain the financial system afloat. We do so by stimulating the financial economy but not the real economy (much) so inflation isn't as pronounced. The latest solution in this strategy came about in 2023 in the form of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) which enables Central Banks to borrow against their existing reserves to stimulate the economy without requiring a congressional approval.

Prices will change because more dollars chase the same asset. Therefore understanding elasticity of demand is essential. It shows change in quantity demanded of one good given a change in price of another. To forecast asset inflation we turn to the legacy methods of stimulating an economy. One asset example is 'wheat'. Its demand is inelastic because we must consume it. Recessions necessarily change inelastic prices more. Think of these as dominoes:

### FISCAL & MONETARY POLICY: The Money Supply v Interest Rates
As a Central Bank (CB) decreases interest rates institutions and individuals borrow more and the money supply (MS) increases. However, MS also creates pressure on rates. As the CB stores government securities (at their request) this increases MS as governments spend the same value. In a secondary effect, the CB now also gains the option to lend more at lower rates to commercial banks which in turn increase investments. Eventually, the economy gets heated causing inflationary pressure and when it is high enough the CB increases rates to fight inflation, also causing currency appreciation. **RELEVANCE:** New planned expenditure (ie. war, health, education) is stimulatory in the short-run. 

**Below:** The correlation between the money supply and interest rates is clearly negative. However, rates aren't going below zero which means that the economy must maintain its positive tragectory via another means. In come planned expenditures and the BTFP to save the day. One may even speculate on problems which already have a solution.

### EXCHANGE AND TRADE POLICY: Currency Depreciation (via Absorption & Trade Liberalisation) v Exports
The third approach relates to 'absorption' (only effective when employment is high). Consider that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) equals Consumption (C) plus Investment (I) plus Government (G) plus Net Exports (NX), and that Absorption (A) equals C + I + G, and that the Balance of Trade equals NX. Here, government decreases A to manage inflation, depreciate the currency and increase exports. Results will differ based on the size of capital intensive exporting industries. **RELEVANCE:** The announcment of a balanced budget is stimulatory for exporting capital intensive industries (ie. infotech, biotech, defense, and finance) especially when regional or global needs arise.

The fourth and less common approach is to open the economy (although it is not necessarily optimal for large economies as they can sustain some use of tariffs without starting trade wars). In small (price taking) economies the optimal approach to maximise overall surplus (welfare) is to reduce trade barriers. While developing countries mainly export primary goods, developed countries export manufactured goods which have a higher elasticity of demand. Therefore, opening the economy stimulates it as more products are capital intensive. **RELEVANCE:** As governments of price setting economies announce trade liberalisation, exports from those industries will be stimulatory.

**Below:** The Trade Weighted Dollar (TWD) is the value of the dollar against the top 17 currencies in the world. Here we see a robust correlation that confirms that as the TWD depreciated, exports have increased. However, because all output is a variation of capital times labour, the main difficulty in this approach becomes the lack of human capital.
